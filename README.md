# NotchArrowUtils
A clientside QoL fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.4

# Installation
Install like a normal fabric mod. Configuration and features are all managed through the .json config file that the mod will generate and ingame commands. Support for ModMenu is coming soon but this will add a dependency.

## TODO
- [x] Make a functional mod
- [ ] Add ModMenu support
- [ ] Add **ALL** of the features
- [ ] Fully learn Java
- [ ] Get snack money?
