# Dependencies
You will need:
* [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
* [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)
* [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)

# Information
A comprehensive list of features can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/NotchArrow/notcharrowutils/wiki/Commands).

Additional documentation will eventually be provided discussing ModMenu configuration settings.

This mod is entirely **clientside** meaning it can be used on any server, but some features may flag anticheat or be bannable. Use at your own risk.

Thank you for using my mod! I'd love to hear any feedback.
